# Machne-Learning-Basics-of-NLP

This repository maintains variety of Machine Learning Text Processing Techniques and provides insights into Natural Language Processing.

With this project we able to know the types of Text Processing Techniques.

# Description

In this project we explore Text Processing Techniques.

1) Bag of Words 

2) TF_IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

# Brief Explaination

Bag of Words:

Simple technique to convert Text to Numerical Vector.

A dictionary like representation is created by identifying Unique words from the entire text (Assume we got d-unique words).

Then a vector of d-dimensions is constructed for each record (row).

TF_IDF:

We use some mathematical formulations to convert Text to Numerical vector representation.
